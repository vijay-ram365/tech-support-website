# React + Vite w/ tailwind css

*** work in progress ***

The tech support website is the initial setup of a ticket managing system designed to
organize and track client issues. 

This project was developed to become a learning platform for React and Full Stack web applications. 

The following has been created for initial testing:

  - A basic back-end service has been deployed from Render.com
  - An input form has been created and styled
  - An area to view tickets has been created
  - Tickets can be viewed, created, or deleted from the back-end

Future considerations:
 - Login page
 - React SPA refactor
 - Design changes with TailWind CSS
